This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## "Reactive Core Architecture"

As this project has a web app and a native app that has the same business rule, I will use the concept of "Reactive Core Architecture". This way we will be able to share all the code "Redux" between the platforms. For more information see the [original post](https://medium.com/kuralabs-engineering/reactive-core-architecture-for-react-native-and-react-applications-d590daf4ef8a).
